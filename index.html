you will find the styling in the .css file.-->

<!--the "a href" tag creates a link. In this case, I gave each project its own link so
that it will take you to that particular project on this page. See below where the "id"
of each project div is labeled "project1" or "project2" (etc.)-->

      <h2>IDEAS 120 CLASS PROJECTS</h2>
      <li>PROJECT 1: <a href="#project1">Github Poetry</a></li>
      <li>PROJECT 2: <a href="#project2">Zoom Background</a></li>
      <li>PROJECT 3: <a href="#project3">Twine Game</a></li>
      <li>PROJECT 4: <a href="#project4">Something Else</a></li>
    </ul>

<!--the "class" tag works a lot like the "id" tag, except it's helpful to use for a whole class
of divs - in this case, the "img_left" class will style all the images I want to align to the left
of the page.-->

    <p><h3>PROJECT #1</h3></br> Project 1 was our Flarfpoem Uncreative writing project. Thats right, you heard me, UNcreative writing! This was a very cool experience since I had never done anything like it. Using a text message we copy and pasted into google, that is where the magic began...

<div class="img_right" id="project2"><img src="images/catwtf.gif"></div>
  <div class="text_left">
    <p><h3>PROJECT #2</h3></br> Project 2's objective was to create a video background behind us, like when changing the background in your Zoom meetings. For mine, I decided to use a video of me in the same room i was in, but the video had me walking around in the background. I wanted to create something spooky!

    <p><h3>PROJECT #3</h3></br> For this project, we created a non-linear story/game using the website Twine. I called my game The Magical Forest. I had a lot of fun with this one! </p>

    <p><h3>PROJECT #4</h3></br> And last, but not least, this portfolio is my project 4! I have never done digital art or HTML and CSS coding, so it is definately a work in progress but I am glad I pushed myself! Thank you Ms Funk! :)
